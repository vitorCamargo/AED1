# Algorithms and Data Structure
üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíªü§© Assignments for 'Algorithms and Data Structure' subject about intermediary concepts of programming

## More Information
These projects are all made using the programming language C, however, the speaking language was Portuguese.

### Usage
To execute the program, it's necessary to compile the code and execute the compiled file. For that you need to use the following commmand (for that you need to install the GNU Compiler, if you have Windows, you can use an IDE like: DevC++):

```sh
$ gcc PROJECT_NAME.c ‚Äìo PROJECT_NAME
$ ./PROJECT_NAME
```

### Fila / Queue
This is a library aimed to understand how a queue works, it is a first-in first-out (FIFO) abstract data type that is widely used in computing.

### Lista Duplamente Encadeada / Doubly Linked List
This is a library aimed to understand how a doubly linked list works, which is a linked data structure that consists of a set of sequentially linked records called nodes. Each node contains three fields: two link fields (references to the previous and to the next node in the sequence of nodes) and one data field.

### Lista Sentinela / Sentinel List
This is a library aimed to understand how a sentinel list works. A sentinel node is a specifically designated node used with linked lists and trees as a traversal path terminator. This type of node does not hold or reference any data managed by the data structure.

### Pilha / Stack
This is a library aimed to understand how a stack works, it is a last-in first-out (LIFO) abstract data type that is also widely used in computing.


### Projeto Banco de Dados / Database Project
This project is a software like the SQL (Structured Query Language), but it is developed just in C using differents types of data structures. The idea is create databases, tables, row and queries with the structures help.

### Projeto Calculadora / Calculator Project
This project is a software that can calculate in a specific way the basic mathematical operations (+, -, /, \*) with integer numbers using  a Stack. The program has a input file *arquivo.txt* like this:
```
4 10 15 + * 20/
15 7 1 1 + - / 3 * 2 1 1 + + -
```

and will produce in a output file *saida.txt*, like this:

```
4
5
```

### Projeto Delimitadores / Delimiter Project
The ideia of this project is create a system with Stacks to count delimiters ('{}', '[]' and '()') and garantee that all the delimiters are being closed, for that, the system needs a input file *arquivo.txt* with the text that you want to verify, and in the end, the system will return if everthing is ok or if there's any delimiter error.

### Projeto Empresa / Enterprise Project
This project is a simple storage management using data structures.

### Projeto Leitor de Arquivo / File Reader Project
This project is way to read a input file *arquivo.txt* and read the file N-times until the reader find a determined delimiter.

### Projeto Vetor / Vector Project
This is a library aimed to understand how a vector works, so it was developped few vetor methods using data structure.
